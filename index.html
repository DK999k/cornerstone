        <h1>Cornerstone responsive starter theme for WordPress</h1>

<p>Cornerstone is a WordPress starter theme based on the Zurb Foundation Responsive Framework. Cornerstone aims to provide a lightweight starter theme that is responsive and SEO friendly that web designers can build great looking websites on.</p>

<p>This version of Cornerstone is based on <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/">ZURB Foundation 4</a>. Foundation 4 removes support for IE8. A CSS file to provide support for the IE8 grid is included as part of Cornerstone, but no other support for IE8 can be guaranteed. For a version of Cornerstone based on Foundation 3 go to <a href="https://github.com/thewirelessguy/cornerstone-foundation3">https://github.com/thewirelessguy/cornerstone-foundation3</a></p>

<p>Cornerstone is not meant to be used as is. This theme is designed to be used as a parent theme to create a Child Theme from. If youâ€™re unsure how to do this follow the guide at (<a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes">http://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes</a>). You can download an example Child Theme at (<a href="https://github.com/thewirelessguy/cornerstone-child-theme">https://github.com/thewirelessguy/cornerstone-child-theme</a>)</p>
